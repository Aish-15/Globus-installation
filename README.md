### Introduction to Globus Connect Personal

* Globus Connect is easy-to-install, pre-configured software that turns your laptop, server, cluster or other local resource into a Globus endpoint.

* There are two versions of Globus Connect, one for use with personal machines such as your laptop, and another for use with server-class machines such as campus computing clusters and lab servers.

* Use Globus Connect Personal to enable file transfer to and from your personal machine (laptop or desktop.) A Globus Connect Personal endpoint is intended to be used only by a single user.

* As we are installing Globus directly from the website, then there shouldn’t be any problem.

* Sometimes windows defender stops the user from downloading as it doesn’t recognize the application.

* If your system encounters any problem as such, click on “more info.”

* _This is the most important step when setting up the application for you_ .

* Since we logged in using the organization log in details, it automatically assigns the owner identity to the registered email address.

* _*Collection Name*_ : This field allows the user to name their collection. It can be anything the user can identify the folder for later uses.

* _*Description*_ : The description helps the user to describe their collection.

* _*High Assurance*_ : Unless the user has access to sensitive information like patient records or something, kindly leave the field unchecked. If we click on the high assurance, then the user won't be able to share the information. Afterall, the application helps to exchange information between client and server.

* After all the fields are filled, click on save.

* After you click on save, then this message pops up, “Setup successful.”

* You may click on any of the links below or both. This takes the user to the website.

* Then click on exit setup.

* When the user clicks on exit setup, then it means, Globus personal is successfully connected and is set up on the personal computer for further use.

* This is the landing page if the user clicks on the links provided in the previous section.

* Oops! All the documents in the Documents folder on my personal laptop are being shared on globus and will be accessible to other users.

* Hence we need to change the default folder that only those files need to be shared with other users.

To change the default directory, on tool bar, check for the Globus “g” logo and right click on the logo button.

By right clicking on the logo, a list of different functions appear next to it. On the list, check for ‘options…’ and click on it.

* You may create a new folder for saving all the information relating related to Globus.

* After you land into the folder, then click choose.

* Now, we have successfully saved, the default folder.

* Beware – Just by setting up the default folder doesn’t remove the access to “documents” folder. Hence you need to remove the Documents folder.

* You may give access to the default folder as you wish. But it is preferred to select “writable” instead of  both “writable and sharable.”

* You may click on “Save” to save these changes.

_*Note*_ : Remove the previous default folder by clicking on the folder and tapping on the (-) option. It will remove the folder from the accessible folder list.

* The path now is changes to the default path the user has specified.

* All the files of that folder now being shared on Globus.
